This project was created to practice frontend development fundamentals, responsive UI design, and client-side state management without relying on a backend.

Users can add, edit, delete, and complete tasks. Tasks can be organized into projects, assigned to sections, and optionally given due dates. The app includes search and filtering features, allowing tasks to be viewed as All, Active, or Completed. All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, meaning each user’s data is private to their own device.

- Mobile sidebar with hamburger menu
- Project-based task organization
- Add, edit, delete, and complete tasks

Project Structure:

How to Run:
- Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser
- Or access the application via the GitHub Pages live demo link
